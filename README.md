Peggo is a Go implementation of the Peggy (Gravity Bridge) Orchestrator originally
implemented by [Injective Labs](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/). Peggo itself
is a fork of the original Gravity Bridge Orchestrator implemented by [Althea](https://github.com/althea-net).

## How it works

Peggo allows transfers of assets back and forth between Ethereum and Umee. It supports both assets originating on Umee and assets originating on Ethereum (any ERC20 token).

It works by scanning the events of the contract deployed on  Ethereum (Peggy) and relaying them as messages to the 
Umee chain.
